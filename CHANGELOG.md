## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-18

Foundations. The package installs, registers itself and can be added to a panel —
and does nothing else yet, on purpose.

### Added

- A service provider that merges the package config and loads its translations,
  publishable under `filament-warden-config` and `filament-warden-translations`.
- `FilamentWardenPlugin`, implementing Filament's plugin contract, registering no
  screens.
- The configuration file, with conservative defaults: no manual creation of
  permissions, editing limited to loose ones, deletion limited to orphans.
- English and Spanish translations, pinned to each other by a test.
- A test suite on testbench with a real Filament panel and warden's four tables.
- Six quality gates: style, static analysis, refactoring, line coverage at 100 %,
  type coverage at 100 % and profanity.

### Not included

- No screens: no roles grid, no permissions resource.
- No catalogue derived from policies.
- No policies, no panel guard: **anything this package registers on a panel in a
  later version is open until `0.2.0` closes it**.
- No console commands.
